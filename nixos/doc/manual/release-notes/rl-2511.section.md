# Release 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.11-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Secure boot support can now be enabled for the Limine bootloader through {option}`boot.loader.limine.secureBoot.enable`. Bootloader install script signs the bootloader, then kernels are hashed during system rebuild and written to a config. This allows Limine to boot only the kernels installed through NixOS system.

## New Modules {#sec-release-25.11-new-modules}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- [gtklock](https://github.com/jovanlanik/gtklock), a GTK-based lockscreen for Wayland. Available as [programs.gtklock](#opt-programs.gtklock.enable).

- [FileBrowser](https://filebrowser.org/), a web application for managing and sharing files. Available as [services.filebrowser](#opt-services.filebrowser.enable).

- [SuiteNum√©rique Docs](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs), a collaborative note taking, wiki and documentation web platform and alternative to Notion or Outline. Available as [services.lasuite-docs](#opt-services.lasuite-docs.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.11-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `services.polipo` module has been removed as `polipo` is unmaintained and archived upstream.

- `renovate` was updated to v40. See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/releases/tag/40.0.0) for breaking changes.

- The NixOS `services.restic` module has received an overhaul to fit [RFC42](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-config-option.md). Most of Restic is configurable with environment variables, so now you can specify those environment variables verbatim in `settings` option.

Most Restic-related options can be configured via `settings`, but no all of them. In particular, things like backup `paths` and `exclude` patterns can't be specified in `settings` due to a limitation in Restic. Also, extended options that can be specified with `extraOptions` don't have corresponding environment variables; for that reason, they are untouched.

Due to a technical limitation in Nixpkgs, automatic migration is not possible. You will have to migrate manually. The migration path looks like this:

- `services.restic.backups.foo.passwordFile -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings.RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE`
- `services.restic.backups.foo.repository -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings.RESTIC_REPOSITORY`
- `services.restic.backups.foo.repositoryFile -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings.RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE`
- `services.restic.backups.foo.progressFps -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings.RESTIC_PROGRESS_FPS`

Rclone subsystem is also now configured via `settings`. Here's the migration path:

- `services.restic.backups.foo.rcloneOptions -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings`. `rcloneOptions` can be converted to `settings` by replacing `-` with `_`, making all letters uppercase and prefixing them with `RCLONE_`. For example, `rcloneOptions.drive-use-trash = "true"` becomes `settings.RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH = "true"`.
- `services.restic.backups.foo.rcloneConfig -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings`. `rcloneConfig` can be converted to `settings` by making all letters uppercase and prefixing them with `RCLONE_`. For example, `rcloneOptions.hard_delete = true` becomes `settings.RCLONE_HARD_DELETE = "true"`.
- `services.restic.backups.foo.rcloneConfigFile -> services.restic.backups.foo.settings.RCLONE_CONFIG`

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-25.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.clamsmtp` is unmaintained and was removed from Nixpkgs.

- `amdgpu` kernel driver overdrive mode can now be enabled by setting [hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.enable](#opt-hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.enable) and customized through [hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.ppfeaturemask](#opt-hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.ppfeaturemask).
  This allows for fine-grained control over the GPU's performance and maybe required by overclocking softwares like Corectrl and Lact. These new options replace old options such as {option}`programs.corectrl.gpuOverclock.enable` and {option}`programs.tuxclocker.enableAMD`.
